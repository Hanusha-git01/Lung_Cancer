Project Overview
This project uses data analysis and machine learning to understand the factors that influence lung cancer survival rates. By combining my background in Biochemistry with Data Science, I analyzed a large-scale medical dataset to identify patterns related to patient health, lifestyle, and treatment outcomes.

Dataset Description
The analysis was performed on a comprehensive dataset containing 890,000 patient records. Key information studied includes:

Patient Demographics: Age, Gender, and Country.

Medical History: Family history of cancer, BMI, Cholesterol levels, and existing conditions like Asthma or Hypertension.

Lifestyle Factors: Smoking status (Passive, Former, or Active).

Clinical Details: Cancer stage (Stage I–IV) and Treatment type (Surgery, Chemotherapy, or Combined).

Technical Process
Data Cleaning: Used Python (Pandas) to handle a massive dataset, ensuring there were no missing values or duplicate records for a clean analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to see how factors like age and smoking status affect survival.

Data Integrity: Focused on maintaining high accuracy in medical data, which is essential for patient safety and clinical reporting.

Key Skills Used
Data Management: SQL & Python (Pandas/NumPy).

Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Scientific Insight: Applied M.Sc. Biochemistry knowledge to interpret medical variables.

File Structure
Lung_Cancer.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning, analysis code, and visualizations.

lung_cancer_dataset.csv: The raw dataset used for this study.
